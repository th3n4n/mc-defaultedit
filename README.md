## As of now the repository is still being finalized.
### Yes, the pack name is *not available*.
Basically a "default edit" resource pack for Minecraft. 

This resource pack contains JAPPA's default textures from Mojang and backported to work with Minecraft version 1.8+. It is somewhat similar to the TheLegend27 pack but with a few touches from me. The resource pack will *always* be updated with time.

*Textures backported from version/snapshots of 1.21*
# Download
(1.8) Click the green Code button on the top right and then click Download ZIP (or just simply click [here](https://github.com/th3n4n/not-available/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)). Once you've finished downloading, unzip the file to your `.minecraft/resourcepack` folder. 

(1.9+) Do the same steps for 1.8, then download the overlay pack that contains textures for 1.9+ [here](https://github.com/th3n4n/not-available/archive/refs/heads/1.9+-overlay.zip). Once downloaded, unzip the file to your `.minecraft/resourcepack` folder. Enter the game then apply the main pack first then the overlay pack.

**You can always compress the files to save storage space.**
