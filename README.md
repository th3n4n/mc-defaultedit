A "default edit" Minecraft resource pack. 

This resource pack contains *JAPPA's default textures from Mojang and were backported to work with Minecraft **1.8+ while also keeping the pack as lightweight as possible. It is somewhat similar to the TheLegend27 pack but with a few touches from me.

**Textures backported from version/snapshots of 1.21 by me (except for ctm)*

***Lower versions may have improper support*
# Download
(1.8) Click the green Code button on the top right and click Download ZIP (or just simply click [here](https://github.com/badb33ch/not-available/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)). Once downloaded, unzip the file to your `.minecraft/resourcepack` folder. 

(1.9+) Do the same steps for 1.8, then download the overlay pack that contains textures for 1.9+ [here](https://github.com/badb33ch/not-available/archive/refs/heads/1.9+-overlay.zip). Once downloaded, unzip the file to your `.minecraft/resourcepack` folder. Enter the game and apply the main pack first then the overlay pack.

**You can always compress the files to save storage space.**
